# quant
here i explored the field of finance and stock markets by writing some basic code for easing out the bad calculations...(i am a looser at calculations)


The files have some implementation of codes which are used for scientific calculations however the ones which we need to 
use matrices or matlab kind of stuff have been pulled into one of the other repos by the name numpy (python fan)
so just to keep things segregated and in place according to my classifiication even that repo would have to be forked for 
some even more better codes depending on the application the user needs the code for.
